# Medical-Information-Retrieval-System
A medical information retrieval system is specialized software that consists of methodologies and technologies that allow for both efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant medical information from diverse sources that potentially include but are not limited to the web, articles, journals, social media, and hospital records. Information related to health is one of the most searched topics on the internet and is of vast importance to an array of users, such as medical practitioners, researchers, patients, and their families.
The main objective was to implement a medical information retrieval system, i.e., a search engine that is specific to the medical domain, that will retrieve top-ranked relevant documents accurately from the dataset on the basis of the userâ€™s input query to ensure that the user is able to obtain relevant results to cater to varying medical information needs, whether related to diseases themselves, their treatment and medications, or research findings.
